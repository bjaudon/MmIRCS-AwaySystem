Archive of the MmIRCS AwaySystem for mIRC of the early 2000's

This is the collection I have reconstructed of the various versions of AwaySystem I wrote back in the late 90's through early 2000's.
I lost access to the original website due to the company going defunct, and my parent's old computer has long gone before I thought about backing up these scripts.

These scripts were distributed on Geocities [http://www.geocities.com/mmircs](https://web.archive.org/web/20021129155935/http://www.geocities.com/mmircs/) under the mmIRCS and mudpuddle names.

I've included the version descriptions from the original website in the listings below. I was not able to locate some of the original files, so some of them only list the zip file name instead of linking to the actual sources. I'll keep this listing updated if they are found.

For help in loading addons, I've dumped the original Addons Help information from the original site [here.](./addonhelp.md)

[**AwaySystem 1.0 - October 16, 1999**](./AwaySystem%201.0)
  
A complete AwaySystem for mIRC 5.6 with CTCP Pager AwayLog message logging nickname changer, event logging and sound schemes.. All configurable with a neat GUI. Not bad for a first script I think ;)  

*Requires mIRC 5.6*

----------
[**AwaySystem 2.0 - November 9, 1999**](./AwaySystem%202.0)

Version 2 of my AwaySystem. It includes many new features such as: Identify to NickServ on DALnet on return to Back mode, IdleAway, and much more. Bug fixes and a new dialog system using mIRC 5.61 tab dialogs.

*Requires mIRC 5.61*

[**AwaySystem 2000 (2.1.1590) - Janurary 10th, 2000**](./AwaySystem%202000)

AwaySystem 2000 is version 2.1 of my away script. It includes new features such as StealthAway and enabling you to change your away message without dropping out of away. StealthAway allows you to enter Away mode quietly without sending messages to the channel. You may also change your away message without dropping out of away mode, and you can now go into Away mode while you're offline! AwaySystem will then set you to Online away mode. Even the Help file has been rewritten as well as a few dialog mods and squished buggies.

*Requires mIRC 5.61*
